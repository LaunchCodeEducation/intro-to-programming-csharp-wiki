# Lesson 2: Booleans, Conditionals, and Debugging

## In the prep work for this lesson, the students learned:

1. The boolean data type and boolean expressions
1. Logical operators (``>``, ``<``, etc.) and ``==`` 
1. Logical ``AND``, ``OR``, and ``NOT``
1. ``if / else if / else`` statements
1. How to use the compiler to understand errors, warnings, and unhandled exceptions
1. How to use ``Console.WriteLine`` to help debug code
1. How to use ``TryParse`` to help with user input

## Announcements

* Check with your class Candidate Engagement Manager for any announcements.

### Part-Time Students
* Note the due date for the first graded assignment (should be 2 - 4 weeks away).
* The assignment will be active in Canvas soon, and the students will know enough after lesson 2 to begin the first part of the assignment.

### Full-Time Students
* Welcome to Day 2!
* Assignment 1 will be introduced on Day 5

## Large Group Time (Instructor Notes)

### Lesson 2 Topics That Require More Attention

1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
   1. Recommend walking through the debugging exercises to reinforce how to spot the different error types, how to use error messages to find bugs, and how to systematically find and fix logic errors.
1. Review the meaning of the truth tables for logical ``AND`` and logical ``OR``.
1. Clarify with live coding examples:
   1. The difference between an ``if / else if`` block and two successive ``if`` blocks
   1. Nested conditionals
   1. Check multiple conditions with ``&&`` and ``||``
   1. When would we use ``!``?
1. Today the studio is a non-coding activity.
   1. Refer to the TF Notes and prepare a brief intro about why this activity will benefit the students.

## Studio (TF Notes)

1. Even though this is a non-coding studio, it requires more preparation and thought than usual.
1. The studio helps the students build confidence and identify what they want to get out of this class, so it is critical that you play your part well.
1. Refer to the notes you received from LaunchCode as you prepare for and run the studio. You can also access the notes [here](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev-wiki/blob/master/wiki-materials/Goal-Setting-and-Mindset-TA-Notes.pdf).
