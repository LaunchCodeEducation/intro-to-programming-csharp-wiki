# Lesson 6: Methods

## In the prep work this week, the students learned:
1. What a method is.
1. What a parameter is.
1. What an argument is.
1. How to write a method with any number of parameters.
1. How to call a method.
1. What scope is and how it affects method.

## Announcements
1. Check with your class Candidate Engagement Manager for any announcements!
1. If the due date for the first graded assignment has NOT already passed, remind students of the due date for the first graded assignment.

## Large Group Time (Instructor)
### Reminders
1. The grade for your first graded assignment will appear in Canvas.

### Lesson 6 Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Conversation starters:
   1. In a student's own words, can they explain what a method is?
1. What does it mean if the method is `void`?
1. Parameters vs arguments
   1. named, optional, defualt parameters
1. Live coding examples covering scope and how it impacts methods.
1. Methods calling other methods.
1. What recursion is and how a function can call itself.
   1. Reinforce examples of when and why someone may choose the recursive solution. While recursion is  in the chapter, it should NOT receive a large amount of emphasis. At this point in the students' learning journey recursion pushes against the boundary between an engaging challenge and a discouraging frustration.
1. Q & A for any issues with the chapter exercises.
1. Emphasize live coding. In particular, consider creating some function tasks to give to the students as "starters" or to use in walkthroughs.
1. Graded Assignment #2 is open! Remind students that the key to getting the assignment done is to read through everything carefully and start on what you can do as soon as possible. In class, read through the instructions with your students and highlight what they are capable of doing after this class.

## Studio (TF Notes)

### Lesson 6 Studio
1. Reminder: the studio is broken into parts for a reason! Many students may read the initial paragraph and want to jump right in, but that would be doing themselves a disservice.
1. This is a problem that is possible with an inefficient, brute force solution. Encourage students who take that route to take a step back and seek out a more elegant solution.
