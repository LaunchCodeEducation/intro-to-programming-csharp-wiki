1. Forking vs. cloning a GitHub remote repository.
1. Pushing and pulling changes to/from a remote repo.

## Studio (TF Notes)

1. Common student stumbling blocks:
   1. Createing new solution in VS
   1. Creating git repo and connecting the two
   1. Finding the terminal within their particular VS version  (This is completely optional, their main terminal will work).
   1. Some students get confused trying to follow the instructions, especially as they alternate between the **Control** and **Pilot** roles. Be ready to provide clarification.
   1. Some students will be intimidated by merge conflicts. Note that these happen all the time, and they are not that big of a deal.
1. This studio requires students to work in pairs. If you have an odd number of students, you will need to fill in that gap yourself.
